# Desktop Organiser

I am sure that your computer's desktop is cluttered with files. It is very difficult to find files from your desktop when you need them urgently. This repository will help your files with respect to date and file-type so that you can spend more time in productive work than in finding files. :)

### Prerequisites

- Watchdog library for python. 

  ```shell
  pip install watchdog
  ```

### Setup 

**(To be done ONLY ONCE!)**

- Run the following command to create a folder with the required structure.

  ```shell
  bash createFS.sh
  ```

- Replace the destination path and folder name in the code to the path and the name of the folder that was created by the above shell script in the desktop.

### Run

- To run the  program execute the python file by: 

  ```shell
  python desktop_organiser.py
  ```
